# Judgment Stewardship Group (JSG)
**Confidence:** High

The **Judgment Stewardship Group (JSG)** is the **domain-scoped** stewardship construct.

In HDDL terms: JSGs steward **decision authority** for a domain by owning calibrated envelopes, routine domain arbitration within calibrated bounds, and succession.

This is distinct from the **Decision Stewardship Group (DSG)**, which exists only for **cross-domain** arbitration and boundary collisions.

## Canon Summary

Judgment is stewarded by teams, not individuals.

JSGs:
- Own domain decision envelopes
- Approve and evolve domain calibration (within their scope)
- Govern succession and overlap for domain decision authority

Note: cross-domain arbitration belongs to the DSG.

### Resiliency Escalation Path

The **Resiliency Steward** escalates to the Judgment Stewardship Group (JSG) when:

- Judgment degradation persists across domains
- Autonomy narrowing exceeds a single domain’s authority
- Tradeoffs between speed and correctness require cross-domain alignment
- Steward authority boundaries are unclear or contested

The JSG adjudicates:
- Whether autonomy should remain narrowed
- Whether calibrations must be rolled back or retired
- Whether domain decision envelopes require revision
