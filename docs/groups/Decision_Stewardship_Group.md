# Decision Stewardship Group (DSG)
**Confidence:** High

Decision authority is stewarded by teams, not individuals.

The DSG is a cross-domain construct that appears **only** when decision authority crosses domains or envelope boundaries collide.

---

## What the DSG Does

- Arbitrates conflicts between envelopes
- Resolves overlapping authority
- Reviews decisions that exceed local steward scope

The output of DSG activity is always an artifact:
- an approved revision
- a constrained revision
- a deferred decision with annotation

---

## What the DSG Does Not Do

- Approve routine work
- Gate delivery
- Own execution
- Act as a per-request reviewer
- Operate as a routine approval body

---

## Properties (Operating Constraints)

- No people management
- No execution ownership
- Explicit overlap and succession
- Collective arbitration when domains collide

---

## Resiliency Escalation Path

The **Resiliency Steward** escalates to the Decision Stewardship Group (DSG) when:

- Decision degradation persists across domains
- Autonomy narrowing exceeds a single domain’s authority
- Tradeoffs between speed and correctness require cross-domain alignment
- Steward authority boundaries are unclear or contested

The DSG adjudicates:
- Whether autonomy should remain narrowed
- Whether calibrations must be rolled back or retired
- Whether domain decision envelopes require revision
