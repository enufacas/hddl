Maya now steers multiple agents. Authority is explicit; autonomy is scoped.

# A Thursday, Two Years Later
**Confidence:** High

Maya was late to the rollout meeting, which meant it was going well.

She joined just as Engineering finished their summary:

> “The frontier model is ready. We’ve scoped it under existing HDDL constraints. No expansion of decision authority without steward sign-off.”

Maya nodded. This was familiar ground now.

## Promotion Changed the Surface, Not the Role

Two years ago, she had stewarded a single domain. Now she chaired a cross-domain Decision Stewardship Group (DSG).

The difference was not power.

It was scope.

JSGs still owned their domains. They calibrated, compressed, and evolved their own decision envelopes continuously. The DSG only existed for one reason:

**When decisions crossed boundaries, humans had to meet each other.**

## Frontier Models Under Constraint

The new model was faster, broader, and more capable than anything before it. That wasn’t the risk.

The risk was silent authority expansion.

Before rollout, each domain steward presented:

- Which decision classes would remain unchanged
- Which would be narrowed
- Which would explicitly *not* be delegated

One steward declined to participate.

The model would simply not operate in that domain.

No exception was requested. None was needed.

## Arbitration, Not Governance Theater

One conflict surfaced.

A decision class touched Finance and Customer Support simultaneously. Both domains claimed primary stewardship.

The DSG didn’t vote. It didn’t score options.

It issued a constrained revision:

> “Split authority. Support owns initiation. Finance owns closure. Re-evaluate in 90 days.”

The system updated.

The meeting ended early.

Maya closed her laptop knowing something important had *not* happened:

No model had decided who was in charge.
It’s not a ceremony.
