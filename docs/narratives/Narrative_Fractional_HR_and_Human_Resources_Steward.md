# Narrative: Fractional Human Resources Stewardship (Mature Operating Model)
**Confidence:** Medium

Alex works for a firm that provides fractional Human Resources Stewardship to technology companies.

The firm has operated at scale for several years. Its operating model is stable and well understood by its clients.

Each engagement combines human stewardship with a managed fleet of agents that handle cyclical and administrative HR functions. Payroll execution, performance review orchestration, policy enforcement, compliance tracking, and reporting are executed by the firm’s systems. Alex is responsible for how those systems are configured, constrained, and integrated into each client’s environment.

Alex typically supports four companies concurrently.

As a steward role, Alex co-owns people-affecting DTS boundaries with the client’s HR Steward.

## The Stewardship Stack

For each client, the firm deploys a standard capability set:

- payroll and compensation agents
- performance review orchestration agents
- policy enforcement and audit agents
- reporting and summarization agents

These agents operate continuously and autonomously within defined bounds.

Alex’s role is not transactional oversight.
It is stewardship of decision authority where systems affect people.

The automation is not separate from the role.
It is the primary surface through which stewardship is applied.

---

## Client Operating Context

Client companies already operate with significant AI assistance.

They:
- rely on automation for people operations
- expect systems to act autonomously within limits
- treat AI-assisted workflows as standard infrastructure

The firm does not introduce these practices.
It operates within them.

Alex’s responsibility is to ensure that people-affecting decision authority remains explicit, attributable, and revisitable over time, even as systems evolve.

---

## Authority Discoverability

As part of onboarding, senior hires are given access to the company’s decision artifacts and agent configuration.

This material documents:
- which systems participate in performance evaluation workflows
- where AI-assisted summarization is used
- which decisions require explicit human attribution
- how authority boundaries are recorded and revised

Decision authority is expected to be discoverable, not explained.

## Interaction with Engineering Leadership

At one client company, Maya joins as a senior technical leader.

During onboarding, Maya reviews the company’s decision documentation and agent configuration. The structure is familiar. She has seen similar approaches in other environments.

What stands out is that authority boundaries are explicit and inspectable.

Later, during a routine review of the firm’s agent configuration for the company, Alex and Maya briefly compare notes. The discussion is confirmatory, not introductory.

They focus on:
- whether current authority boundaries still fit the organization’s structure
- whether recent organizational changes require re-bounding
- whether any people-affecting decisions need clearer attribution

No process changes are required. The systems already support bounded autonomy.

---

## Day-to-Day Stewardship

Most of Alex’s work is incremental:

- refining agent constraints as roles evolve
- reviewing decision telemetry related to people-affecting outcomes
- updating decision artifacts when organizational assumptions change
- coordinating with other stewards when cross-domain impact appears

Alex does not approve individual transactions.
The agent fleet executes continuously.

Stewardship operates at the level of authority, not execution.

---

## Why the Model Is Fractional

The firm’s ability to operate fractionally depends on its agent infrastructure.

Because agents handle execution, scheduling, enforcement, and reporting, Alex can focus exclusively on judgment boundaries, attribution, trust preservation, and long-term coherence across systems.

The same stewardship patterns apply across companies, even as local implementations differ.

---

## Outcome

From the client’s perspective, day-to-day operations remain unchanged.

Automation continues.
Delivery velocity is unaffected.
Operational overhead does not increase.

What improves over time is:
- clarity around people-affecting decisions
- confidence in autonomous systems
- ease of revisiting authority as conditions evolve

Alex rotates focus across clients.
The agent fleet remains active.
The stewardship model holds.

## Canonical Notes (HRS Story)

The company didn’t eliminate HR.
It elevated it.

The Human Resources Steward (HRS) is a boundary co-owner alongside engineering and operations:

- Co-own DTS boundaries
- Prevent extraction of human judgment
- Ensure portability of human decision equity

When a vendor proposed richer telemetry, the HRS said no.
When leadership asked for replayable decision logs, the HRS said no.
And when managers worried about losing “visibility,” the HRS explained:

> “You’re not losing insight. You’re losing the illusion of control.”

Fractional coverage works because HDDL makes boundaries explicit.
The result isn’t slower decisions.
It’s safer ones.
