## Change Log

- **v9.0** — Canon-wide rename to **HDDL (Human-Derived Decision Layer)** and Decision-based system nouns.
  - Standardized: Decision Workspace, Decision Envelope, Decision Authority, Decision Telemetry, Decision Degradation, Decision Promotion
  - Standardized: **JSG** as domain-scoped stewardship; **DSG** as cross-domain arbitration
  - Embedded HDDL invariants in System Overview and Executive Reference
  - Flagged remaining unqualified “judgment” phrasing for targeted editorial refinement
