# Canon Registry
**Confidence:** Medium

This registry is the authoritative index of all first-class canonical documents in the HDDL corpus.
Any document not listed here is non-canonical.

## Change Log

- **v9.0** — Canon-wide rename to **HDDL (Human-Derived Decision Layer)** and Decision-based system nouns.
  - Standardized: Decision Workspace, Decision Envelope, Decision Authority, Decision Telemetry, Decision Degradation, Decision Promotion
  - Standardized: **DSG** as the stewardship construct for cross-domain arbitration; domain stewards handle domain-scoped calibration
  - Embedded HDDL invariants in System Overview and Executive Reference
  - Removed legacy JSG (Judgment Stewardship Group) terminology
