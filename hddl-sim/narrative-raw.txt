# Baseball Analytics — Performance & Strategy Optimization

This scenario demonstrates how the HDDL framework allows a major league front office to scale complex analytics across performance, health, and roster management without the system silently absorbing the authority of the coaching staff or the General Manager. By using decision envelopes, stewards like Sarah Chen and Marcus Johnson define the precise boundaries where automated agents—like the LineupOptimizer or the BattingAnalyzer—can operate autonomously. This ensures that while the AI handles the heavy lifting of processing Statcast data and historical metrics, the high-stakes judgment calls regarding player careers and team finances remain firmly in human hands.

The power of this collaboration is most visible when execution hits a boundary, triggering a steward review rather than a blind automated action. Late on day one, the BiomechanicsMonitor flagged the team’s ace pitcher after detecting a deviation in his arm slot, signaling an elevated risk of a Tommy John injury^[boundary_interaction:18_7:ENV-BB-003:5]. Instead of the system simply benching the player, Health Steward Dr. Emily Rodriguez reviewed the data and made the authoritative call to mandate a seven-day rest period^[decision:19_1:ENV-BB-003:6]. Similarly, early on day three, the ContractOptimizer blocked a proposed trade for a veteran outfielder because it would have pushed the team over the luxury tax threshold^[boundary_interaction:52_2:ENV-BB-004:10]. This boundary interaction allowed Roster Steward GM David Park to intervene and restructure the deal so the acquiring team covered a portion of the salary, keeping the team under the cap while still securing the talent they needed^[decision:54_1:ENV-BB-004:11].

These interactions create a feedback loop that allows stewards to revise envelopes as the season evolves. Three days into the week, Sarah Chen led a mid-season analytics review where the team discovered that exit velocity was a better predictor of power than their current models suggested^[dsg_session:72:ENV-BB-001:12]. She subsequently revised the performance envelope to weight that metric more heavily, immediately improving home run projection accuracy by 12%^[revision:76:ENV-BB-001:13]. Toward the end of the week, as the team prepared for the postseason, Strategy Steward Marcus Johnson recognized that the urgency of October baseball required a different risk profile. He revised the in-game strategy envelope to relax bullpen rest requirements, allowing for more frequent appearances while maintaining enhanced medical monitoring^[revision:144:ENV-BB-002:18]. 

By the end of the week, the success of this governed autonomy was clear: the team finished with 94 wins, exceeding projections by 12 games while maintaining a healthy roster with zero major injuries in the final month^[signal:168:ENV-BB-001:34]^[signal:96:ENV-BB-003:14]. This demonstrates the core principle of HDDL: decision memory captures the patterns of these expert choices—like the optimal lineup construction against left-handed pitchers^[embedding:4:ENV-BB-002:19]—to support future decisions, but the authority to change the rules of the game remains a human prerogative. The result is a system that scales the precision of AI while preserving the nuanced judgment of the humans responsible for the team's legacy.
