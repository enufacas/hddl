# Test Minimal — Fast Test Harness

This scenario demonstrates AI governance in a testing domain, highlighting how automated agents operate within defined decision envelopes, and how human stewards maintain authority through feedback loops and revisions. Two envelopes, "Test Policy" owned by the "policy" role, and "Test Queue" owned by "operations", define the constraints for agents performing automated tests. "TestBot Alpha" operates within both envelopes, while "TestBot Beta" only operates within the "Test Policy" envelope.

Initially, at hour 1, "TestBot Alpha" made a decision to approve a standard test case, operating within the constraints of the "Test Policy" envelope. However, at hour 2, a boundary interaction occurred when "TestBot Alpha" escalated to the "policy steward" because a test threshold was exceeded. This boundary interaction triggered steward review. The steward, informed by the decision memory showing similar escalation patterns (EMB-001), then approved an exception at hour 3.

This boundary interaction initiated a feedback loop. At hour 4, informed by the steward's decision (EMB-002), the "policy steward" revised the "Test Policy" envelope, raising the threshold to prevent future escalations of the same type. The revision, recorded as event "revision-test-1", explicitly documents the change to the envelope's constraints. Later, at hour 5, "TestBot Beta", operating under the original "Test Policy" envelope constraints, was denied a test case, demonstrating how the revised envelope impacts agent behavior. This cycle of boundary interaction, steward decision, and envelope revision illustrates how governance evolves based on operational experience, guided by the decision memory (EMB-003).

This scenario demonstrates the power of HDDL to enable scaled autonomy while preserving human authority. Agents can operate autonomously within defined envelopes, but when boundary conditions are met, human stewards are engaged to make informed decisions. These decisions, in turn, lead to envelope revisions, ensuring that the system learns and adapts based on real-world experience, all while maintaining explicit and inspectable decision authority.
