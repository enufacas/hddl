# Insurance Underwriting — Risk Assessment & Claims

This scenario demonstrates the application of the HDDL framework within the insurance domain, focusing on the dynamic management of decision authority across risk assessment and claims processing. Over the course of a week, the system managed 73 distinct events through nine versioned envelopes, ensuring that autonomous agents remained within human-defined boundaries. The central theme of this operation is the transition from static automation to a model where decision authority is explicit and revisable, allowing stewards to scale underwriting processes without losing the essential element of human judgment.

The collaboration between automated agents and human stewards is structured through these envelopes, which define the constraints under which agents like the RiskScorer and FraudDetector operate. Stewards such as Rebecca Foster in underwriting and Marcus Chen in claims do not act as manual approvers; instead, they serve as domain-aligned authorities who define and revise the envelopes. When agents encounter conditions that exceed their current assumptions—such as complex risk profiles or suspicious claim patterns—they trigger boundary interactions. These signals are then reviewed by stewards like Diana Patel in compliance or Alicia Rodriguez in pricing, who use the feedback to determine if the envelope requires a revision to accommodate new operational realities.

The evolution of these governance boundaries is best illustrated through the six feedback cycles that occurred during the week. Early on the first day, a boundary interaction was detected, leading to a formal envelope revision within the hour to refine agent behavior. This pattern of rapid adaptation continued into the second day, where an early morning boundary interaction triggered a steward review and a subsequent revision by midday. By early on day three, another significant boundary interaction occurred, resulting in a comprehensive revision to the envelope constraints later that afternoon. These cycles demonstrate how the feedback loop functions as a mechanism for continuous improvement, where steward decisions are captured as part of a transparent lineage.

By the end of the week, the HDDL framework had enabled a highly responsive governance structure that balanced scale with accountability. The use of decision memory allowed stewards like the ClaimTriager and the ThresholdEscalator to discover precedents from past events, supporting consistent decision-making across the 73 events. Ultimately, this scenario shows that by making decision authority explicit and bounded, organizations can ensure that their AI systems remain extensions of human intent, evolving through deliberate steward revisions rather than autonomous drift.
