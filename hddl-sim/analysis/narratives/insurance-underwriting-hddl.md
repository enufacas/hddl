# Insurance Underwriting — Risk Assessment & Claims

This scenario illustrates AI governance in insurance underwriting and claims processing, demonstrating how autonomous agents can operate within defined boundaries while preserving human authority. The scenario uses decision envelopes to manage risk assessment, claims triage, premium pricing, and regulatory compliance. Human stewards retain control by defining assumptions and constraints within these envelopes, ensuring that AI-driven decisions align with business objectives and ethical considerations. Agents like RiskScorer, ClaimTriager, and QuoteGenerator operate within their respective envelopes, leveraging historical decision memory to inform their actions.

The Underwriting Steward, supported by agents like RiskScorer and ThresholdEscalator, manages the "Policy Risk Assessment" envelope. At hour 5.3, the ThresholdEscalator agent encountered a boundary when a homeowner's policy exceeded the high-risk threshold due to elevated flood risk and prior claims. This boundary interaction escalated the application to Senior Underwriter #12, who consulted decision memory and approved the policy with a flood mitigation requirement. This triggered a feedback loop: at hour 6.2, the Underwriting Steward, Rebecca Foster, revised the envelope to codify the flood mitigation requirement as a constraint for similar high-risk coastal properties, ensuring consistent application of this underwriting standard. Similarly, the Claims Steward, overseeing the "Claims Triage & Fraud Detection" envelope, saw the FraudDetector flag a claim at hour 12.4 due to multiple prior claims, an inconsistent damage timeline, and a flagged repair shop. Although initially escalated, the claim was later approved after investigation. As a result, at hour 19.1, Claims Steward Marcus Chen refined the envelope's assumptions to exclude cases with different vehicle registrations in claim history analysis, reducing false positives.

The "Premium Pricing & Quote Generation" envelope, stewarded by Alicia Rodriguez, also underwent revisions based on operational experience. At hour 28.7, the QuoteGenerator agent triggered a boundary interaction by calculating an 18% renewal increase, exceeding the 15% limit defined in the envelope. While the Pricing Steward initially approved the increase with a retention offer, this triggered a revision at hour 30.5. Alicia Rodriguez updated the envelope to allow increases up to 20% when paired with retention incentives, providing the agent more flexibility while maintaining customer transparency. These examples demonstrate how boundary interactions trigger steward review and lead to envelope revisions, refining agent behavior and aligning it with evolving business needs.

This scenario exemplifies how HDDL enables scaled autonomy in a complex domain. By explicitly defining decision authority and establishing clear feedback loops, the insurance company can leverage AI to improve efficiency and accuracy while preserving human judgment and control. Stewards actively shape agent behavior through envelope revisions, ensuring that AI-driven decisions remain aligned with ethical considerations, regulatory requirements, and business objectives. The use of decision memory enhances consistency and allows for precedent discovery, but ultimate authority rests with the human stewards who define and revise the decision envelopes.
