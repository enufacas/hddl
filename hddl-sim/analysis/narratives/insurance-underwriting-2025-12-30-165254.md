# Insurance Underwriting — Risk Assessment & Claims

This scenario demonstrates the application of the HDDL framework to the high-stakes world of insurance, where precision in risk assessment and fairness in claims processing are paramount. By establishing explicit decision envelopes for underwriting, claims, pricing, and compliance, human stewards ensure that autonomous agents can scale operations without sacrificing the nuanced judgment required for complex cases. The narrative highlights how the system moves beyond static automation into a dynamic governance model, where every boundary interaction serves as a signal for stewards to refine the constraints and assumptions that guide agent behavior.

The daily operations rely on a fleet of specialized agents operating within strictly versioned constraints. Early in the week, the RiskScorer agent evaluated a standard auto policy, retrieving baseline risk patterns from decision memory to recommend a fair rate^[decision:2_8:ENV-INS-001:3]. However, the system is designed to recognize its own limits. When the ThresholdEscalator agent encountered a homeowner's application with a high risk score due to coastal flood history, it triggered a boundary interaction rather than making an unguided call^[boundary_interaction:5_3:ENV-INS-001:4]. This moved the decision to a senior underwriter, who approved the policy only after adding a specific constraint for flood mitigation, such as a sump pump installation^[decision:5_7:ENV-INS-001:5]. This collaboration ensures that while agents handle the bulk of the work, human stewards like Rebecca Foster remain the final authority on complex risk.

These boundary interactions are not just interruptions; they are the primary drivers of a continuous feedback loop that evolves the company's policy. Late on day one, after reviewing the coastal property case, Rebecca Foster revised the underwriting envelope to codify the flood mitigation requirement for all similar high-risk properties, ensuring future consistency^[revision:6_2:ENV-INS-001:5a]. Similarly, Marcus Chen noticed that the FraudDetector was flagging legitimate claimants because of multiple vehicles in their history. To reduce these false positives, he refined the envelope's assumptions on day one to exclude cases with different vehicle registrations from fraud analysis^[revision:19_1:ENV-INS-002:10a]. By mid-week, Alicia Rodriguez managed a pricing tension where a renewal increase exceeded the 15% threshold. She approved an 18% increase by pairing it with an accident forgiveness program^[decision:29_1:ENV-INS-003:13], subsequently relaxing the envelope constraints to allow up to 20% increases when combined with specific retention incentives^[revision:30_5:ENV-INS-003:13a].

By the end of the week, the system demonstrated how scaled autonomy remains safe through explicit governance and decision memory. Compliance steward Diana Patel ensured the entire process remained transparent by revising the compliance envelope to require structured justification templates for all denials, closing an identified explainability gap^[revision:54_2:ENV-INS-004:16b]. This HDDL framework transforms the AI from a "black box" into a partner that respects human-derived boundaries. Instead of automation silently absorbing authority, every exception becomes an opportunity for a steward to refine the envelope, ensuring the company’s risk appetite and ethical standards are consistently applied even as the system processes thousands of claims and policies.
