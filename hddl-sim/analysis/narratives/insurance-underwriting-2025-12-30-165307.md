# Insurance Underwriting — Risk Assessment & Claims

This scenario demonstrates how the HDDL framework enables an insurance provider to scale complex underwriting and claims operations without losing the nuance of human judgment. By establishing explicit decision envelopes across four key domains—Underwriting, Claims, Pricing, and Compliance—stewards like Rebecca Foster and Marcus Chen define the boundaries where automation ends and human authority begins. Rather than simply following static rules, agents like RiskScorer and FraudDetector operate within envelope constraints that are constantly refined by human stewards. This ensures that while 72% of policies might be auto-approved to maintain efficiency, the most complex and sensitive cases are always surfaced for human review, preserving the company’s commitment to fairness and regulatory transparency.

The collaboration between automated agents and human stewards is best seen in how the system handles high-stakes exceptions. Early on day one, the RiskScorer agent identified a standard auto policy, but when it encountered a coastal property with a high risk score of 89/100, it triggered an escalation based on the high-risk threshold constraint^[boundary_interaction:5_3:ENV-INS-001:4]. This wasn't a failure of the system, but a designed boundary interaction. Senior Underwriter #12 stepped in to review the specific risk, ultimately approving the policy on the condition that the homeowner install a sump pump^[decision:5_7:ENV-INS-001:5]. This human judgment—balancing underwriting rigor with the practical reality of property protection—was then codified by Rebecca Foster. She revised the envelope to require flood mitigation verification for similar high-risk properties^[revision:6_2:ENV-INS-001:5a], ensuring that future agents would benefit from this specific piece of human decision-making.

The scenario highlights several critical feedback loops where operational reality led to envelope revisions. Midday on day one, Marcus Chen observed a boundary interaction when the FraudDetector flagged a claim for having multiple prior incidents in a short window^[boundary_interaction:12_4:ENV-INS-002:7]. Upon review, an adjuster found the claims were legitimate because they involved entirely different vehicles. To prevent this "false positive" from slowing down honest customers, Chen revised the envelope assumptions to refine the vehicle tracking logic^[revision:19_1:ENV-INS-002:10a]. Similarly, early on day two, Alicia Rodriguez addressed a pricing conflict where a necessary 18% renewal increase was blocked by a 15% constraint^[boundary_interaction:28_7:ENV-INS-003:12]. Recognizing the need to balance profitability with customer loyalty, she revised the pricing envelope to allow increases up to 20%, provided they are paired with retention incentives like accident forgiveness^[revision:30_5:ENV-INS-003:13a]. These revisions show a governance model that evolves through real-world experience rather than remaining a rigid set of instructions.
