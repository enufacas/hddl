# Insurance Underwriting — Risk Assessment & Claims

This insurance governance scenario demonstrates the HDDL framework’s ability to manage complex underwriting, claims processing, and pricing strategies across four distinct decision envelopes. By establishing explicit boundaries for automated agents, the framework ensures that high-stakes financial decisions—ranging from risk scoring to fraud detection—remain under the authoritative oversight of domain-aligned stewards. Throughout the five-day operational period, the system balances the need for rapid, automated execution with the necessity of regulatory compliance and human judgment, using decision memory to maintain consistency while allowing stewards to refine the boundaries of autonomy in response to real-world edge cases.

Operational agents such as RiskScorer and FraudDetector operate within strict envelope constraints, such as the prohibition of protected characteristics in risk scoring^[ENV-INS-001] and the requirement that agents never auto-deny claims^[ENV-INS-002]. When execution reaches these predefined boundaries, the system triggers a boundary interaction for steward review. For example, agents like ThresholdEscalator and QuoteGenerator utilize decision memory to query historical patterns, such as coastal property flood risks^[retrieval:5_25:ENV-INS-001:3a] or renewal pricing strategies^[retrieval:28_2:ENV-INS-003:12a], before determining if an escalation is required. Stewards like Rebecca Foster (Underwriting) and Alicia Rodriguez (Pricing) do not act as mere gatekeepers; instead, they use these escalations as signals to revise envelopes, ensuring that the automation’s underlying assumptions and constraints evolve alongside market conditions and operational experience.

The evolution of these policies is best illustrated through iterative feedback loops. Early on day one, the ThresholdEscalator agent flagged a homeowner’s policy for elevated flood risk, triggering an escalation^[boundary_interaction:5_3:ENV-INS-001:4]. After a senior underwriter approved the policy with specific conditions, Rebecca Foster revised the Policy Risk Assessment envelope to codify a new constraint requiring flood mitigation verification for similar properties^[revision:6_2:ENV-INS-001:5a]. Similarly, early on day two, the QuoteGenerator agent hit a boundary when a renewal increase reached 18%, exceeding the 15% limit^[boundary_interaction:28_7:ENV-INS-003:12]. Following a review by Alicia Rodriguez, the envelope was revised to relax this constraint, allowing increases up to 20% specifically when paired with retention incentives like accident forgiveness^[revision:30_5:ENV-INS-003:13a]. Mid-week, a sophisticated boundary interaction occurred when the FraudDetector identified an organized fraud ring involving staged accidents and repair shop collusion^[boundary_interaction:62_5:ENV-INS-002:17a]. This led Marcus Chen to revise the claims envelope to expand its assumptions, incorporating cross-claim network analysis and GPS validation to strengthen future detection^[revision:66_8:ENV-INS-002:17c].

By the end of the week, this HDDL-governed system achieved significant scale, with 72% of 1,847 policies auto-approved while maintaining a projected loss ratio of 62%, well within the 65% target^[signal:120:ENV-INS-001:25]. The use of decision memory and structured revisions allowed stewards like Diana Patel to address explainability gaps by adding constraints for justification templates^[revision:
