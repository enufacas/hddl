# Baseball Analytics — Performance & Strategy Optimization

This scenario demonstrates how a professional baseball organization uses the HDDL framework to manage the massive influx of Statcast data, turning raw metrics into a competitive advantage while keeping human judgment at the center of the dugout. By establishing decision envelopes for performance, strategy, health, and roster management, the team allows autonomous agents like BattingAnalyzer and LineupOptimizer to handle the heavy lifting of daily projections and in-game adjustments. The goal isn't to replace the manager or the GM, but to provide them with a bounded environment where AI-driven insights—like the recommendation to promote a top shortstop prospect based on elite contact skills^[decision:8_2:ENV-BB-001:3]—can be executed with confidence because the underlying assumptions and constraints are explicitly defined and steward-owned.

The collaboration between human stewards and automated agents is most visible when the system hits a boundary. Late on day one, the BiomechanicsMonitor detected an arm slot deviation in the team’s ace pitcher after a high-pitch-count outing, triggering a boundary interaction for elevated injury risk^[boundary_interaction:18_7:ENV-BB-003:5]. Dr. Emily Rodriguez, acting as the Health Steward, didn't just see a data point; she saw a potential season-ending injury. Within the hour, she reviewed the signal and approved a seven-day rest period, triggering a rookie promotion for a spot start^[decision:19_1:ENV-BB-003:6]. This illustrates how HDDL
