# Human Resources Steward (HRS)
**Confidence:** Low

The Human Resources Steward (HRS) owns the **people-affecting decision authority surface**.

This role exists to protect:
- human judgment (within decision boundaries) from extraction and erosion
- fairness and bias boundaries in people-impacting automation
- non-invasive telemetry boundaries (especially for performance and engagement)

HRS is stewardship of **authority**, not approval of transactions.

## Owns

- Human-preferential constraints for systems that affect people
- People-affecting decision authority boundaries (what can be automated, where attribution is required)
- Fairness and bias boundaries for people decisions
- DTS telemetry boundaries for people domains (bounded, non-surveillance)
- Decision-load protection (preventing people from being over-queried or constantly assessed)

---

## Explicitly Does Not Own

- People management
- Performance evaluation
- Running engagement theater

---

## Operating Posture (Canonical Shape)

- Make authority discoverable, not explained.
- Allow automation, but require **bounded telemetry** and **human attribution** where outcomes affect people.
- Treat “non-surveillance” as a trust posture and (often) a recruiting advantage.

---

## Interfaces

- Decision Stewardship Group (DSG) for cross-domain people-impacting boundary conflicts
- Data Steward for contamination/embedding hygiene risks in evaluative contexts
- Engineering/Domain Stewards for tool onboarding and envelope enforcement
