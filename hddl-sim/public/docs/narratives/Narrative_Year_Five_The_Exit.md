# Year Five: The Exit
**Confidence:** High

Human judgment within decision boundaries is portable, but systems are not.

### Interface Moment: Steward-Led Interpretation

**Human (Natural Language)**
> “I want to take my human judgment within decision boundaries with me, without leaking anything that belongs to the company.”

**System Interpretation**

# Year Five: The Exit
**Confidence:** High

The story people tell about exits is usually about betrayal or heroics.

In an HDDL-shaped organization, exits are mostly about boundaries:
what is portable human judgment, and what is non-portable organizational decision IP.

## It’s Not One Person Leaving

The first message is calm:

> “We’re leaving together. Three of us. We’re starting something.
> We want to do this clean.”

It’s a team-based exit.
Not a surprise.
Not a leak.
Not a fight.
# Year Five: The Exit
**Confidence:** High

The email arrived on a Monday.

> “We’re spinning out the platform team. Transition window is 90 days.”

No one panicked.

They had planned for this.

## Judgment Is Portable. Decision IP Is Not

The team gathered—not to download data, but to export *themselves*.

Each steward ran a familiar command:

```bash
stewardctl decision export --personal
```

What they received was not code.

It was a structured summary of:

- Decision classes they had stewarded
- Boundary patterns they had shaped
- Calibration moves they had personally authored
- Outcome ranges they were accountable for

No organizational telemetry left with them.

No proprietary decision policy crossed the boundary.

But their **judgment capital** did.

## A Team Exit, Not a Hero Story

They left together.

Not as a brain drain.

As a *coherent unit of judgment*.

Within weeks, they were productive elsewhere—not because they brought secrets, but because they knew how to *rebuild envelopes without surveillance*.

Their former employer retained everything it owned.

They retained everything they were.
