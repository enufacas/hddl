# Continuous Stewardship
**Confidence:** Low

Stewardship is continuous observation and envelope tuning, not episodic intervention.

Stewardship in an HDDL system is continuous operational work focused on:
- expanding safe autonomy
- reducing friction
- compressing recurring human intervention into durable decision envelopes

This is not rare intervention.
This is not idle oversight.

## Stewardship Responsibilities

- Observe envelope performance continuously
- Expand autonomy where evidence supports it
- Tighten constraints where reality pushes back
- Promote repeated human steering into standing decision authority
- Retire stale defaults as tools and models evolve

---

## Envelope Optimization Actions

- Promote shadowed actions to live
- Increase blast radius safely
- Remove legacy constraints
- Merge or split envelopes
- Reduce escalation frequency

---

## Cadence (Typical)

- Observation: continuous
- Micro-adjustments: weekly
- Material envelope changes: monthly
- Structural recalibration: quarterly

These timings are canon-but-illustrative defaults:
- The structure (continuous stewardship exists; calibration is continuous) is canon.
- The exact frequencies are adjustable by org/domain.

Smell tests (commentary-level heuristics):
- If stewards are busy every day, the system is failing.
- If stewards never intervene, the system is stagnating.
