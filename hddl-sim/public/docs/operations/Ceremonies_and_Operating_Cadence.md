# Ceremonies and Operating Cadence in an HDDL-Native Organization
**Status:** Canon
**Confidence:** Medium

Cadence is **normative in structure** (stewardship is continuous), but **illustrative in frequency** (exact timing is adjustable by org/domain).

---

## Intent

An HDDL-native operating cadence exists to:
- keep decision authority bounded and revisable
- prevent silent authority expansion
- compress recurring human intervention into durable decision envelopes

Cadence is stewardship discipline, not approval bureaucracy.

---

## Cadence (Typical Defaults)

From `Continuous_Stewardship.md` (illustrative defaults):

- Observation: continuous
- Micro-adjustments: weekly
- Material envelope changes: monthly
- Structural recalibration: quarterly

If stewards are busy every day, the system is failing.
If stewards never intervene, the system is stagnating.

## Steward Operational Checks (Illustrative)

From `Steward_Playbook.md` (illustrative defaults):

Cadence:
- Daily environment checks
- Weekly calibration reviews
- Quarterly succession audits

---

## Outputs

When this cadence runs correctly, it produces artifacts (not meeting notes):
- decision envelope revisions
- calibration updates
- escalation decisions (when cross-domain) captured as DSG outputs
