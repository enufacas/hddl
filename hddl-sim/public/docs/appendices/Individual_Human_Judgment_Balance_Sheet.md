# Individual Human Judgment Balance Sheet
**Confidence:** Medium

Human judgment is a personal asset accrued through decisions and outcomes.

This balance sheet is a conceptual tool for understanding how individuals accumulate (and lose) judgment capacity over time, and how an HDDL-aligned organization should protect that asset while scaling autonomy.

Human judgment is referenced here only in the bounded sense: it matters most **within decision boundaries** where a human is responsible for defining and revising decision authority.

## Assets

- **Judgment capital**: hard-won intuition built through repeated decisions, feedback, and responsibility.
- **Steering authority**: the ability to shape systems and outcomes because others trust your judgment.
- **Outcome attribution**: traceable credit/blame at the decision level (not covert people-scoring).
- **Portability (within bounds)**: the ability to carry precedents and artifacts where allowed.

Additional asset examples (illustrative):
- **Boundary clarity**: the ability to articulate “allowed vs escalated” for a decision class.
- **Reversal literacy**: comfort admitting error and revising decisions based on outcomes.

---

## Liabilities

- **Drift**: your priors no longer match reality; past success becomes stale.
- **Extraction risk**: your judgment signals are harvested without consent/attribution, degrading trust and autonomy.
- **Overgeneralization risk**: applying a pattern outside its valid domain; success becomes an unsafe template.

Additional liability examples (illustrative):
- **Overreach**: taking authority beyond defined envelopes or outside domain competence.
- **Unbounded exposure**: being placed in constant escalation without envelope repairs.

## Usage

Use this to reason about:
- when authority should expand or narrow
- when stewardship work is needed to prevent extractive measurement
- how to preserve attribution as autonomy scales

Practical uses that fit HDDL posture:
- Assigning stewardship responsibilities to experienced domain owners (not by title, but by earned authority).
- Identifying when a domain is accumulating “silent authority” in systems and needs envelope work.
- Detecting extraction patterns (telemetry creep, hidden people-scoring, private signal capture).

---

## What This Is Not

- A performance rating rubric.
- A justification for surveillance.
- A mandate to quantify individuals.

If a balance sheet becomes a scoring system, it becomes extractive and undermines the asset it claims to measure.

---

## Guardrails (HDDL-Aligned)

- Human judgment must not be harvested via DTS or any adjacent telemetry.
- DTS remains: telemetry about decisions, never telemetry of thinking.
- Retention of granular signals stays short by default (days to low weeks); long-lived artifacts should be compressed, attributable decision records.
- Authority expansion should be expressed as envelope changes, not informal “because Alice is good.”

## Lightweight Template (Optional)

Assets (what you can safely carry):
- Decision classes you can own within envelopes
- Reversal track record (examples)
- Boundary clarity (examples)

Liabilities (what degrades your judgment capital):
- Drift risks (where your priors may be stale)
- Extraction risks (where signals are being harvested)
- Overreach risks (where boundaries are unclear)
