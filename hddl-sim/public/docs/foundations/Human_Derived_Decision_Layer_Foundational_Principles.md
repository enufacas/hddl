# Human-Derived Decision Layer — Foundational Principles
**Confidence:** Low

Human judgment (within decision boundaries) is not an emergent property of models.
It is an asset that must be stewarded, governed, and protected.

HDDL exists to make **decision authority** explicit and durable as execution becomes cheap and automated.

## Core Assertions

- Authority should be explicit, bounded, attributable, and revisable.
- Systems may execute autonomously **only within human-defined bounds**.
- Revision is normal: assumptions drift, signals diverge, and envelopes must change.
- Telemetry must be bounded and non-invasive; surveillance is not a valid substitute for stewardship.

## Human Judgment as an Asset

Human judgment (and the authority derived from it) should be treated as:
- **Durable** — it persists beyond a single interaction
- **Attributable** — it is clear who owned the authority boundaries
- **Portable (within bounds)** — it can move with a person/org change without becoming covertly extractive

---

## Authority vs Execution

HDDL separates:
- **Decision authority** (who is allowed to decide what)
- **Execution** (how work is carried out)

This separation prevents “automation drift” where systems silently accumulate authority.

---

## Decision Envelopes

Decision Envelopes are the primary operating contract: explicit artifacts that define what is allowed, what is prohibited, when escalation is required, and who owns revisions.

---

## Stewardship

Stewardship is continuous responsibility for:
- maintaining envelope quality
- expanding safe autonomy
- protecting people-affecting boundaries

---

## Lineage Note (JaS)

Earlier drafts used the phrase **Judgment as Infrastructure (JaS)** to name the core idea that human judgment is an asset.
This document retains the underlying definition while using HDDL terminology.
