  "narrative": "# HDDL Replay (Simplified) — Four Fleets\n\nInside the busy corporate headquarters, the digital pulse of four distinct operational fleets began to beat under the watchful eyes of their human stewards. Early in the scenario, the Customer Steward promoted the first authority envelope to govern response automation, setting a clear two-minute response constraint for the ReplyAssist agent^[envelope_promoted:2:ENV-001:0]. While the system initially hummed along with stable latency, the human impact of these boundaries became clear when a customer requested a high-value refund. The RefundGuard agent identified a request exceeding $100 and, following its envelope constraints, blocked the autonomous action and routed the case to me for review^[decision:12_55:ENV-001:7]. This boundary interaction was a critical signal that the system had reached the edge of its delegated authority^[BI-ENV-001-001]. To evolve the process, I looked through the decision memory for precedents and then revised the envelope to version 2, adding a new assumption that all such escalations must now include a bounded evidence packet to streamline my review process^[revision:13_1:ENV-001:9].\n\nMidway through the first day, a similar feedback loop unfolded in the sales department when the DiscountGuard agent blocked a deal that exceeded the 15% discount limit^[decision:16_35:ENV-003:11]. As the Sales Steward, I saw the pressure for higher discounts rising and realized the agents needed a more structured way to handle these outliers without proposing discriminatory pricing^[BI-ENV-003-001]. I closed the loop by revising the sales envelope to require an explicit evidence packet for any discount over the threshold, ensuring that human judgment remains the final arbiter for high-stakes revenue decisions^[revision:17:ENV-003:13]. Simultaneously, the Data Steward was managing technical boundaries as SchemaGuard detected drift in the database schema that threatened production consumers^[signal:20:ENV-004:14]. By revising the data access envelope, the steward ensured that all future schema changes would require a versioned migration note and a steward-approved contract, preventing silent failures in the data pipeline^[revision:20_8:ENV-004:16].\n\nToward the end of the second day, the most sensitive boundary interaction occurred within the hiring fleet when the HR Steward noticed a drift in candidate scoring distributions^[signal:36_2:ENV-002:17]. Our core assumptions in this domain are non-negotiable: protected classes must never be inferred, and humans must always make the final hiring call. To address the signal divergence, we held a cross-domain fairness review session to ensure that no proxy features—like candidate location—were being used by the agents to bypass our bias guardrails^[dsg_session:39:ENV-002:20]. I decided to tighten the feature allow-list, revising the hiring envelope to version 2 to explicitly disallow location-based proxy features without a formal signoff^[revision:39_6:ENV-002:22]. This revision was immediately committed to decision memory, serving as a permanent precedent that proxy-inference indicators are treated as immediate escalation triggers^[annotation:39_8:ENV-002:23]. \n\nBy the end of the 48-hour window, these four fleets demonstrated how HDDL enables scaled autonomy while preserving human authority. Rather than acting as gatekeepers for every minor task, the stewards used boundary interactions as signals to refine the envelopes agents operate within. This process of constant revision and feedback ensures that as the business scales, the AI remains bounded by human-derived values and explicit constraints. Whether it was managing a $100 refund or protecting the integrity of the hiring process, the framework ensured that every significant decision was traceable, versioned, and ultimately steered by a human steward.",
