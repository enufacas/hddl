## Deployment

This project is deployed to GitHub Pages as a Single Page Application (SPA). To enable deep-linking and direct navigation to any route (e.g., `/specification`, `/authority`), the build process generates a `404.html` file that mirrors `index.html`. This allows GitHub Pages to serve the SPA shell for any unmatched path, letting the client-side router handle the routing.
